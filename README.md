# COSC 326 - Android Development - Labs
## Lab Assignments:
Each labs codebase is contained within the appropriate root folders. Wherever a project was fully functional an `./{lab}/apk/` directory exists with the `APK` and `JSON` which would, under normal circumstances, be submitted into Moodle.

## Notes:
Lab 5 -> while it sucessfully builds and appears to run fine within the emulator, does not register/perform any of the notification functions properly. Not sure why, and as there's (to my knowledge) no proper way to debug this (logcat had no input) adn therefore there isn't a pre-uploaded APK - however the code is still there showing all the required assignment components.

Sorry for the late submission :(
